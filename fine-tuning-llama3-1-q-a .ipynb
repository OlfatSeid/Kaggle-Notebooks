They were brought to the US as part of the transatlantic slave trade, which began in the 16th century and continued until the 19th century.

It works by creating a partial vacuum at the pump's inlet, which draws water into the pump. The water is then compressed and pushed out of the pump through a discharge pipe. This process is repeated continuously, creating a flow of water. The pump's motor or engine drives the pump's moving parts, such as the impeller or piston, which create the pressure difference needed to move the water. The pump's efficiency and capacity depend on various factors, including the type\u001b[0m\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"]}],"source":["FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model)\n","\n","def unsloth_pipeline(model, tokenizer, input_text, max_new_tokens=128):\n","  \n","    tokens = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n","    \n","    generated_tokens = model.generate(tokens, max_length=max_new_tokens)\n","    \n","    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(generated_tokens[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n","    \n","    return generated_text\n","\n","example_indices = [0, 10, 20]    # Explicitly select three different examples by index \n","\n","\n","for i in example_indices:\n","    row = dataset[\"test\"][i]\n","    question = row['question']\n","    document_title = row.get('document_title', '')  \n","    original_answer = row['answer']  \n","    input_text = f\"Question: {question}\\nDocument title: {document_title}\\nAnswer:\"\n","    predicted_answer = unsloth_pipeline(model, tokenizer, input_text)\n","\n","  \n","    print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n","    print(f\"Document title: {document_title}\")\n","    print(f\"Original Answer:   {COLOR_ANSWER}{original_answer}{COLOR_RESET}\")\n","    print(f\"Generated Answer: {COLOR_PREDICTION}{predicted_answer}{COLOR_RESET}\")\n","    print(\"-\" * 100)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## üõ†Ô∏è **Train** & üè¶ **Save**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-28T07:32:48.562944Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-28T07:32:48.562041Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-28T07:32:54.403907Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-28T07:32:54.402882Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-28T07:32:48.562896Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Unsloth: Dropout = 0 is supported for fast patching.

Additionally, many free African immigrants came to the US as laborers, sailors, and students from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act also led to an increase in African immigration to the US.

In the United States, the first prisons were established in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. These early prisons, such as the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia (1773) and the New York City Gaol (1797), were designed to hold a limited number of inmates, typically around 100-200 people. They were often overcrowded and unsanitary, with inmates facing harsh conditions and limited access to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare.

The impeller accelerates the water, increasing its velocity and pressure.\n","3. **Chamber**: The water then enters a chamber or casing, where the pressure\u001b[0m\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"]}],"source":["model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model,new_model)\n","\n","model.eval() \n","\n","def unsloth_pipeline(model, tokenizer, input_text, max_new_tokens=128):\n","  \n","    tokens = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n","    \n","    generated_tokens = model.generate(tokens, max_length=max_new_tokens)\n","    \n","    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(generated_tokens[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n","    \n","    return generated_text\n","\n","example_indices = [0, 10, 20]  \n","\n","\n","for i in example_indices:\n","    row = dataset[\"test\"][i]\n","    question = row['question']\n","    document_title = row.get('document_title', '')  \n","    original_answer = row['answer']  \n","    input_text = f\"Question: {question}\\nDocument title: {document_title}\\nAnswer:\"\n","    predicted_answer = unsloth_pipeline(model, tokenizer, input_text)\n","\n","  \n","    print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n","    print(f\"Document title: {document_title}\")\n","    print(f\"Original Answer:   {COLOR_ANSWER}{original_answer}{COLOR_RESET}\")\n","    print(f\"Generated Answer: {COLOR_PREDICTION}{predicted_answer}{COLOR_RESET}\")\n","    print(\"-\" * 100)  "]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
