Two staff members, each of whom spent 4–5 hours daily on backups, have been redeployed to the infrastructure team because backups are now automated on AWS.

The company has improved productivity and employee satisfaction with seamless system performance and achieved 100 percent uptime since migration.\n\nThe company worked with AWS Partner Inteliwaves on the SAP implementation and migration and is using\n\nVishal Shah director at Sterling Auxiliaries, says, “The infrastructure setup and onboarding to SAP S/4HANA on AWS was a smooth process, and we’ve had a great experience with Inteliwaves. Virtual servers in the production and development environments were available when we needed them, which allowed us to meet our deadline.”\n\nLow latency\n\nSince launching SAP S/4HANA on AWS, Sterling Auxiliaries reports significant time savings, faster performance, and improved employee satisfaction with a highly available SAP environment. “We’re saving a lot of time now that we don’t need to wait around during server lags,” says Chavan. We can accomplish the work quicker and use our time for other activities such as SAP system audits and application planning.”\n\nScaled to support 10x increase in web traffic\n\nFurthermore, with the older SAP R3 Setup on premises, the business experienced one or two days of downtime each month and regular connectivity challenges slowed down or prevented employees from carrying out their work. For example, when there was a power outage in Mumbai—where Sterling Auxiliaries’ SAP R3 servers were located—factory workers in Gujarat couldn’t access the system, leading to delays in dispatching materials. Backups were also a cumbersome, time-consuming process on premises.\n\nSterling Auxiliaries worked with partner Inteliwaves to implement SAP S/4HANA on AWS, automating backup, and saving time with improved system performance.\n\nSterling Auxiliaries Resolves SAP Downtime and Boosts Productivity to Fuel Business Expansion on AWS\n\nTürkçe\n\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud\n\nDeployed resources in minutes versus weeks\n\nEnglish\n\nPerformance improvements, plus the new implementation of the SAP DMS module on AWS, have also facilitated document transfer among teams. “Overall, our factory and back-office employees are much happier with SAP S/4HANA on AWS. They can retrieve documents, save data, and generate reports faster,” Chavan adds.\n\nWhen asked about the company’s plans, Shah says, “The success of this project has prompted us to evaluate cloud-based solutions for other legacy systems in 2023. We’re also planning to implement SAP S/4HANA on AWS for other business divisions that have been running SAP on premises.” Sterling Auxiliaries’ export business is growing annually, so having a low-latency SAP backbone will be key as the business expands.\n\nSupport\n\nSAP S/4HANA on AWS\n\nAWS Partner Inteliwaves, Sterling Auxiliaries deployed\n\n2 weeks\n\nAmazon Elastic Block Store\n\nDeutsch\n\nAWS Backint Agent with\n\nTiếng Việt\n\nThe company has been using SAP software since 2006, with SAP as the foundation for operations at its headquarters and its main factory in the state of Gujarat.
